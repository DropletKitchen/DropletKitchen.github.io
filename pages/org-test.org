#+BEGIN_abstract
     /This document/ demonstrates how to use ~emacs org-mode~ to
     generate an article formatted for a =Nikola= website. It
     combines a number
     of the most common features required, such as citations, figures,
     tables and cross-referencing. As such it serves as a test-suit for
     the configuration and at the same time as documentation in form
     of a collection of usage samples.

* Required Emacs Configuration
To enable ~bibtex~ processing ~pdflatex~ needs to be called multiple
times and ~bibtex~ needs to be called. A simple solution to get the
required call sequence is the use of ~latexmk~.

*** Mixed List
 My favorite scenes are (in this order)
 1. The attack of the Rohirrim
 2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
    + this was already my favorite scene in the book
    + I really like Miranda Otto.
 3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
    - on DVD only
    He makes a really funny face when it happens.
 But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
 Important actors in this film are:
 - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
 - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
   him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.

* Referencing and Linking
 We refer to the literature here
 \cite{AdamG68BioDiffProc}. Of course we can also refer to tables such
 as Tab. [[tb:sample]]. As can easily be understood in Fig. [[fg:cross]],
 there is nothing to see in the Subsection [[PNG Images]] of Section
 [[Figures]]. Most of this is done with [[http://orgmode.org]], however for
 TiKZ images[fn:1: See http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/.] more
 LaTeX source is required as can be seen in Fig. \ref{fg:curves}.

* Math[fn:3: Following http://spot.colorado.edu/~sitelic/samplecode/latex/AiryBessel.html]

 \begin{equation}
   Ai(z) =
        \frac13\sqrt{z}\left[
        I_{-1/3}(\zeta)
        -I_{1/3}(\zeta) \right]\\
         =
         \pi^{-1}\sqrt{z/3}K_{1/3}(\zeta)\\
   Ai(-z) =
        \frac13\sqrt{z}
        \left[
        J_{1/3}(\zeta) +
        J_{-1/3}(\zeta) \right]\\
        =
        \frac12 \sqrt{z/3} \left[
        e^{\pi i/6} H_{1/3}^{(1)}(\zeta)
         + e^{-\pi i/6}H_{1/3}^{(2)}(\zeta)
         \right]
 \end{equation}



     If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
     either $a=+\sqrt{2}$, or $a=-\sqrt{2}$.




** Inline Calculations
See http://ehneilsen.net/notebook/orgExamples/org-examples.html#sec-10.
This results in a value of
src_python{return "%4.1f" % (1.3**(3.0/5.0))} {{{results(=1.2=)}}} =1.2=.



* Special Blocks
** Source Code
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defun Fib (n)                          ; Count rabbits.
        (if (< n 2) n (+ (Fib (- n 1)) (Fib (- n 2)))))
#+END_SRC


*** Bash marked as 'sh'
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
for f in *.png; do imgshrink -j -shrk $f; done
reanme 's/-shrk././' *.jpg
#+END_SRC

*** Bash marked as 'bash'
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
for f in *.png; do imgshrink -j -shrk $f; done
reanme 's/-shrk././' *.jpg
#+END_SRC





** Block Environments
*** Example (verbatim)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    This sentence is false.
#+END_EXAMPLE


Arbitrary latex environments can be associated with an org-mode
block[fn:3: For further usage samples see
http://orgmode.org/manual/LaTeX-specific-attributes.html]

*** Note

#+BEGIN_note
Note, that this is a note.
#+END_note


* Direct HTML
#+BEGIN_HTML
<img src="/images/test.png" height="60"> <img scr="/images/src.png height="60">
#+END_HTML

** Other
#+BEGIN_HTML
<img src="figs/scr.png">
#+END_HTML



* Misc Org Markup
** Emphasis and monospace
 You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =verbatim= and
 ~code~, and, if you must, +strike-through+. Text in the code and
 verbatim string is not processed for Org mode /*specific syntax*/, it is
 exported verbatim.
** Paragraphs, line breaks, and quoting

/From the org-mode manual:[fn:4:See http://orgmode.org/manual/Paragraphs.html.]/

Paragraphs are separated\\
by at least one empty line. If you need to
enforce a line break\\
within a paragraph, use '\\' at the end of a line.

To keep the line breaks in a region, but otherwise use normal
formatting, you can use this construct, which can also be used to
format poetry.

     #+BEGIN_VERSE
      Great clouds overhead
      Tiny black birds rise and fall
      Snow covers Emacs

          -- AlexSchroeder
     #+END_VERSE

When quoting a passage from another document, it is customary to
format this as a paragraph that is indented on both the left and the
right margin. You can include quotations in Org mode documents like
this:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Everything should be made as simple as possible,
     but not any simpler -- Albert Einstein
     #+END_QUOTE

If you would like to center some text, do it like this:


#+BEGIN_CENTER
     Everything should be made as simple as possible, \\
     but not any simpler
#+END_CENTER


#+BEGIN_ASCII
Some ASCII Text.
#+END_ASCII
** Horizontal Rule
