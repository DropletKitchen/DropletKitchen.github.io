This project describes how to make simple but high quality syringe
pumps we use for microfluidics research. They are built with a
consumer grade 3D-printer or with a laser cutter. Pump control is
achieved by a graphical software frontend that additionally allows for
live modifications and straightforward automation.

[[../images/rig-cage.jpeg][file:../images/rig-cage-shrk.jpeg]]

This project details how to embed optics based on standard cage and
tube systems into sturdy microfluidic rigs with a small footprint. The
approach uses mainly laser-cut acrylic sheets, and M6 nuts and bolts
as structural components.

With the same approach from above, small microfluidic rigs equipped
with inexpensive board cameras can be designed that are well suited
for simple requirements, for example real-time quality control for
generating samples.

* [[https://github.com/DropletKitchen/strobe][Light Strobing to Improve Images from Cameras]]



In this project an electronics circuit for strobing LEDs or laser
diodes is shown that allows to significantly improve the performance
of global shutter cameras to image fast events. The circuit is
controlled by a microcontroller and a graphical software frontend. As
is, it allows to generate light pulses with a duration down to one
microsecond.
